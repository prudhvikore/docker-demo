#Docker commands


##build

-> docker build -t <set image name> <path>


##basic

-> docker run <image>
-> docker run -it <image> (-it creates a terminal and will open inside the terminal. ctrl+d to come out of the container)
-> docker run -it --name <set container name> <image> (sets a name for container)
-> docker run -it -p 8000:8000 my-app (first 8000 --> laptop port, second 8000 --> container port, and they are both mapped)
-> docker run -it -P my-app (automatically maps with random port in the laptop with EXPOSEd port in the docker file) (ex: EXPOSE 8000 (search for this line in docker file) (we can expose n 
    number of ports like --> EXPOSE 8000 8080 5432 3000, and they all will be mapped with a random port and also we can give a range of ports like --> EXPOSE 8001-8010))
    "-P" is the key for auto port mapping
-> docker run -it --rm my-app (removes the container the moment it is stopped)
-> docker run -itd my-app (runs in detached mode. has all the interactivity but at first, it wil run in detached mode. you can exec into the ttl later by using next exec command)
-> docker exec -it <container-name-provided after running above command> sh (this takes you back to allocated terminal and runs a shell)


##containers

-> docker ps (returns only running containers)
-> docker ps -a (or) --all (returns all the containers)
-> docker ps --help (will give all the options available for containers)
-> docker container rm <container_id> (removes a container)


##images

-> docker images, docker image ls, docker image list (returns all the images)
-> docker image rm <image_name>
-> docker inspect <image> (returns all configuration of the image)
